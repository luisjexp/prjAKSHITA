# <u>SCHEDULE</u>

# **INTRODUCE YOURSELF!**

Discuss interest and goals: 

- Academic: computer science, virtual reality, data driven decision making, education, 
- Careers: applying to colleges in the US, improve her maths, statistics, programming, and college application skills

Discuss knowledge and courses taken in progress: 

- high level highschool math, other AP courses, statistics, writing, some programing

Brain-storm research projects

- choose a research topic that can help her learn new skills, improve current skills, and achieve the goals stated above. One example of such a topic is machine learning, specifically neural networks. This field tackles all sorts of topics.

Discuss communication methods 

- have chosen to exchange emails throughout the week to play with some more ideas about machine learning, so that by next week we will have a concrete topic to create a research project out of.

## Due

First draft of the paper End of week

*The first complete draft of the research should  be completed. This means that the student will have completed all of the  major sections of the paper. At this point, itâ€™s important to give direct  feedback to the student on the paper, reflect on strengths, and identify  areas for improvement.*
